New technology,\\xa0\\xa0 such as the analysis of satellite images, makes it\\xa0\\npossible to reinterpret the layout of the monument\\xa0\\xa0 and reveal clues about what the site, obscuring\\xa0\\nany remnants of the past. A location where people\\xa0\\xa0 continue to live gets built over, gets reused and\\xa0\\nredone. But seeing a satellite image, we are able\\xa0\\xa0 to see the larger layout. So my work can show what\\xa0\\nhas been the evolution of how the landscape has\\xa0\\xa0 been used from the time it was initially built\\xa0\\ntill now. So if you look at a satellite image,\\xa0\\xa0 the area south of the main entrance of Taj\\xa0\\nMahal also has a pattern, a square pattern,\\xa0\\xa0 which is of the same measurement as one of\\n\\nit's made of. We can achieve a magnification of\\xa0\\xa0 between 10,000 and 50,000, compared to optical\\xa0\\nmicroscopes, which reach a magnification of just\\xa0\\xa0 1,500. The microscopic study reveals that this\\xa0\\nmortar is not only made of minerals. We can see\\xa0\\xa0 that the mortar is also made up of small grains,\\xa0\\nwhose appearance is reminiscent of the morphology\\xa0\\xa0 of plants. And probably it's actually seeds. It's\\xa0\\nquite surprising to find plant debris in mortar.\\xa0\\xa0 Several types of plants have been identified. I\\xa0\\nalso isolated black particles. It's hard to tell\\xa0\\xa0 if they are mineral or plant species. But they\\xa0\\ncould be spices, like pepper, for example. By\\xa0\\xa0 analyzing the composition of the mortar under\\xa0\\nthe microscope, scientists have discovered the\\xa0\\xa0 presence of many natural materials. Sugar, spices,\\xa0\\nchickpea flour, a local fruit, and tree resin.\\xa0\\xa0 Investigators have shown that the ingredients have\\xa0\\nhighly impermeable properties. This analysis of\\xa0\\xa0 the mortar, coupled with the analysis and mapping\\n\\nand the central tomb chamber at the Taj Mahal is\\xa0\\xa0 surrounded by eight chambers, which represent the\\xa0\\nHasht Bheesh, or the eight gateways of paradise.\\xa0\\xa0 The dome and the minarets represent the ascent of\\xa0\\nsouls to heaven. Even the imperfections found here\\xa0\\xa0 demonstrate the desire to represent paradise on\\xa0\\nearth. They believe that only God can be perfect.\\xa0\\xa0 Human beings are not perfect. And very often,\\xa0\\nthey do induce a small element of imperfection to\\xa0\\xa0 keep up to that work. The Taj Mahal is an icon of\\xa0\\nbeauty. Its stunning symmetry, exquisite detail,\\xa0\\xa0 and gleaming finish make this monument unique. I\\xa0\\nthink the Taj Mahal is an incredible building that\\xa0\\xa0 has caught the people's imagination for almost 400\\xa0\\nyears. New technology has allowed scientists to\\xa0\\xa0 carry out a complete reassessment of the Taj Mahal\\xa0\\nand its grounds. Studying its foundations reveal\\xa0\\xa0 that the builders used techniques from civil and\\n      Question: explain the video summary in 5 lines and start each line with numbers sequence?\\n      \")"
